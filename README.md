# EnjoyTheOutdoors

This is the Capstone 2 for YearUp Learn to Code (Frontend Program). The project includes a navigation bar that guides the user to a mountain information page and a national parks finder page. Both pages feature dropdowns that showcase arrays and loops. Radio buttons are clicked in order to generate a dropdown response. Once an item in the dropdown is selected the corresponding information will follow from what is chosen in the form of a card.

## Usage
1. Homepage - Displays a carousel showcasing different pictures of mountains and outdoor adventures. Users are able to click on some of the carousel slides in order to navigate to the other webpages if they do not want to use the navigation bar. 
2. National Parks Page - Users are met with a greeting of what they can expect when they search using this site's Adventure Finder. Using two radio buttons, the user has the option to either pick to search by location (or state) or they can serach by park type. The corresponding dropdown will appear based on the radio button that is clicked and the user can click on any of the items in the dropdown in order for their options to appear. 
3. Similar to the National Parks Page, the Mountain Information page also welcomes the user with a greeting on what they can expect when using the Mountain Explorer tool. This page has a dropdown that shows 48 different mountain options that the user can choose from. Once a mountain is selected a card will appear showing the name of the mountain, a short description, the elevation, and the effort it takes to climb.
